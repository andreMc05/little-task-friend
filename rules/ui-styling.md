# UI & Styling

## Design Tokens

Use CSS custom properties (design tokens) as the styling system. Define tokens for:

- **Colors** - Primary, secondary, background, text, borders, etc.
- **Spacing** - Consistent spacing scale (margins, padding, gaps)
- **Typography** - Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Focus** - Focus ring styles and colors
- **Motion** - Animation durations and easing functions

## Consistency

Favor consistency over novelty. Reuse patterns and components rather than creating new variations.

## Components

Components should be:
- Simple
- Predictable
- Accessible
