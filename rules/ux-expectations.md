# UX Expectations

## User Control

Users must always have a clear way to cancel or back out of an action.

## Destructive Actions

Destructive actions require confirmation. Never delete or permanently modify data without explicit user confirmation.

## Data Loss Prevention

No silent data loss. If an action will result in data loss, warn the user clearly.

## Clarity

Interfaces should be self-explanatory without relying on jargon. Use clear, plain language that users can understand immediately.
